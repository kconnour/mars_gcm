This repository is for using Mars (global/general) (circulation/climatology)
models. It includes setup instructions and info about the models themselves.

** Important **: 
From Ehouarn at LMD: "The (LMD) GCM is far from being 'plug and play' and 
that the install script is just a simple basic example and that some work and 
thoughts will be required to actually set up the experiment to address a given
scientific question, and for that step (especially for those not familiar with
Martian GCMs) it might be worthwhile discussing with us."
